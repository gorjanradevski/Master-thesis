\begin{abstract}
In this thesis, the problem of cross-modal retrieval in the image-text and text-image case are studied. I leverage the fact that most of the time, multiple entities are present in the modalities, so a model that is able to focus at different aspects of each individual modality should overpower simpler models that "look only once". Moreover, most of the approaches that tackle the cross-modal retrieval problem are used as a black box, and it is indistinguishable how a corresponding image was matched with the sentence query and vice versa. Lastly, the cross-modal retrieval datasets are small and the training data is scarce. Due to that, in this thesis a heavy emphasis is placed on transferring the knowledge from models that were trained on millions of data samples on different tasks. In this thesis, I present \textit{Siamese multi-hop attention} which overcomes the aforementioned obstacles when doing cross-modal retrieval in the image-text case. \textit{SMHA} is tested on a variety of datasets that include both small ones Pascal1k, Flickr8k as well as medium to large ones Flickr30k and achieves state-of-the-art results on most of them. The code developed in this thesis has been made available at: \href{https://github.com/gorjanradevski/SMHA}{https://github.com/gorjanradevski/SMHA}
